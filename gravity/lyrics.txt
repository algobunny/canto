[6] If I was a big girl
[7] Would you come closer to me
[6] The law of attraction
[7] A reign of massive bodies

Chorus:
[7] This is the thousandth love song
[5] titled gravity
[8] Oh no, not another love song
[5] about gravity

~*~
What about me and Castro?
Collision of heads
Roller coasters
Jack Black, school of rock

Bridge:
[7] This is the thousandth love song
[5] titled gravity
[6] Grab me there eh-heh-eh
[6] Let me grab you there eh
