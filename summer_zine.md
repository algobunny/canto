## Waffles & Dingles

Ave B, slightly above Houston is a favorite place
for occasionally well behaved kids and their parents.
And couples on the edges of a relationship; a place
of first dates and _ goodbyes.
Maybe the bouncy belguim waffles and the whipped cream
softens the fall; powder sugar coat the blow

- fallen hope  (first date turned last date)   
And sometimes first and last dates like honey bacon crepes are wrapped up in one.
They had been sneaking around for a while, empty conference rooms
Stolen kisses on the elevator, joining of legs under the cafeteria table
Rendevous on the 7th Ave line on 42nd, after a night of drinking with fellow co-workers
Hidden pastries from the Cinnamon Snail, left in the kitchen cabinets 
But never a date, this morning here over hot-cocoa and waffles was suppose to be their first.


- losing deep connection (going back to an ex)  
- lack of agency (fwb one moving to London)  
- betrayl/lost of trust (metamors dumping their mutual partner, for betraying them)    
- lost of safe harbor/deep connection  (friendship break up)
