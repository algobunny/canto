[5] Drizzle rain, ran past you
[6] What a smile, what a smile

Maybe I'll do this dance with you
Got me building inertia
Feeling the momentum, I can't stop now

You're moving so fast,
When you hit the impact. Oh the impact
Pierce deep into my heart. Oh so deep

Pull me closer, and I'm spinning faster and faster, into you depths

[7] Sold on all we could have been
[10] Maybe I was sold on the illusion of him

Chorus:
[9] Never will we walk down Bourbon Street
[9] Forever I'll be waiting for you
[10] Clever are your lies, sever them so sweet

Never is a bluesy New Orleans swamp-pop song
It's about a relationship that never materialized
because the person disappeared.
It contemplates on all the things it could have been
such as painting on a acid trip on one's smooth back
