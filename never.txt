[5] Drizzle rain, ran past you
[6] What a smile, what a smile

Maybe I'll do this dance with you
Got me building inertia
Feeling the momentum, I can't stop now

Who knew, the boy who
wears his heart on his left sleeve
had cards up his right

Chorus:
[9] Never will we walk down Bourbon Street
[9] Forever I'll be waiting for you
[10] Clever are your lies, sever them so sweet

You're moving so fast,
When you hit the impact. Oh the impact
Pierce deep into my heart. Oh so deep

Pull me closer, and I'm spinning faster and faster, into you depths

Chorus

Bridge:
[10] You must be some hell of a religion
[10] Despite the overwhelming truths and proofs
[6] I still believe your sweet lies,
[11] when you whisper into the nap of my neck
[7] Words you even wished were true

Chorus

~*~
Never is a bluesy New Orleans swamp-pop song
It's about a relationship that never materialized
because the person disappeared.
It contemplates on all the things it could have been
such as painting on a acid trip on one's smooth back
