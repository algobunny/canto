# Costo

American politics is a Lay's variety pack,
you get at Costco because you love
Cheetos and Doritos; the chips are ok
you'll eat them eventually. But who
buys a lone bag of Fritos.

Sure, there are other parties; two axii
x:economic regulation; y: social acceptance.
And you can slide anywhere along the quadrant
but at the end, we grant power to one
or the other. It doesn't matter if you 
disagree with policies passed by your rep.
If you want a few, you must buy them all

Maybe it's easier to subscribe oneself
to a batch of beliefs, they call religion.
Maybe you seek community when
you joined your local socialist party.
Maybe you should have gone to the bodega
to buy only Cheetos and Doritos...

but Costco is easier... and cheaper!
So you load the variety pack into your Ford
and park it in your drive-way because your garage
is filled with unopened Fritos
