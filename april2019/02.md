# Constellation sonnet

## Scorpion's Kiss
Young man, never gamble

with a man, who knows

his way around the table

Your doubts he’ll expose


His kiss makes you stumble

...venomous lips, oxytocin flows

When your heart starts to crumble;

All its shards he will dispose


Don’t lean in for the scorpion’s kiss

Can’t you feel his tail draw you near?

It is not his bite you should fear

For one touch will send you into the abyss
