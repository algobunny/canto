# blackout poems

rarely spoken; unseen moral war  
drive through unexpected territory,  
absorbing moments...  
sublty. underline circle of impact  

surrounded by soundscape in the motifs of decay  

weave atmospheric story that crafts the past  
Journey where darkness drapes over silver  
...mesmerizing feet between rock;  
solitude surface.  

a dream that grows dripping thought
