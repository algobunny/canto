# Rituals for Reviving a Zombie Heart

Rising from a pond of your tears

Racing to beat Apollo into the day

Run through the park to forge paths uncharted

Rescue from the sweet abyss dreams, lost to the bliss of their embrace

Rave against bodies, intimate yet distant, into the depths of night

Remembering their smile unwinds miles you've paved, and you must restart the

Rituals for reviving a zombie heart.
