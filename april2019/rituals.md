# Rituals for Reviving a Perished Heart

Rising from a pond of your tears

Racing to beat Apollo into the day

Run through the park to forge paths uncharted

Rescue from the sweet abyss your dreams, which were lost to the bliss of their embrace

Raves, strobelights, gyrating into the depths of night; intimate yet distant  

Remembering their smile unwinds miles you've paved, and you must restart the

Rituals for reviving a perished heart.
