# Tongue

Whether you're in your room or the subway 
take this gift, from my mind  
delivered to your eyes  
to be enjoyed through your lips

Tonsils fall into rhythm  
Teeth bites on a rhyme  

My words, your choice  
Your verse, their voice  
Their song, I rejoice  
At our manifesto!

transforming into notions evoluting
emotion seeds overgrown garden  
Together transmitting a revolution
