# Tongue

Whether you're in your room or on the subway 
take this gift, from my mind  
delivered to your eyes  
to be enjoyed through your lips

Tonsils fall into rhythm  
Teeth bite on down a rhyme  

My words, your choice  
Your verse, their voice  
Their song, and I rejoice  
our manifesto!

transform into notions evoluting
emotion seeds overgrow in a garden  
Together, transmitting a revolution
