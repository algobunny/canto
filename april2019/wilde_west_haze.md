# Wilde West Haze

Night falls the Pacific spreads her moist essence  
upon the city's many breasts  
The city of refuge beckons with  
her golden crimson lips 
for the moon's tongue to sing ocean's songs   
peaceful lapping, violent and clashing  
upon gates and cliffs built to imprison her virtue   
But these man-made structures shall be grinded to sand  
while the city welcomes the Pacific into her bay
