_Inspired by Diane Warren's Unbreak My Heart_  

a Decrypt my heart  
b1 Find the cypher to reveal my secrets  
b2 May my love departed be a pheonix  

a' Summon again the anguish fragmenting me apart  
b' Burn our moments into you with no regrets  
a Decrypt my heart  
b1 Find the cypher to reveal my secrets  

a' Recover the emotions I cannot parse    
b' Deactivate lock holding me sleepless  
b' Your smile exposing my weakness  
a Decrypt my heart  
b1 Find the cypher to reveal my secrets    
b2 May my love departed be a pheonix
