Mark of the Victim

[7] Wonder why I never win
[7] Forever the scavenger
[8] Redemptor of another's sin
[7] Bless this luckless challenger

[7] Loved ones slip through my embrace
[7] I crawl alone in disgrace
[7] Why me, why again still me

Chorus:
[7] Burn the mark of the victim
[8] No longer helpless will we stand
[8] Claim agency in our hand
[6] These relutant soliders
[6] are bearing arms today

[7] Curse your hypnotizing glares
[6] I must stop another
[7] From falling into your snares
[8] No more can you feign innocence

[7] Nevermind my kindness
[6] Let these hands be bloodied
[7] From gripping your beating heart

Chorus
