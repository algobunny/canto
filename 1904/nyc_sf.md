# Australian Sonnet

New York, I love you but you're freezing me out 
your lights jump starts my heart, but you don't  
feel the same. I want to be with you forever, but you won't  
fight for me. Even together you'll never washout doubt  

Enumerating reasons to remain in your artic embrace  
Ignoring the draw to feel her breathe upon my neck  
How may we salvage our affair from this shipwreck?  
How much distance between you and I is enough space?   

Blindfolded, I can stroll downtown to your alleys  
But I yearn for her palm tree lined _calle_  
Her eternal sunshine conducting the _primavera ballade_  
I want to glide up her bossom; fall into her valleys  

Time to lay hopes for you and I to rest  
And roll a dice in the grande wild west
