# Sonnetina Uno

the whole world falls away

# Toppled cappucino love story   
Our love story is a broken cookie   
When I halfed the cookie to share with you  
offering a peice of my heart, so eagerly tore  
with blind force that I knock over my cup  
Sweet gestures seeping into our world  
re-manifest as unruly accidents.  

Our love story is toppled cappucino  
Coffee seeping through the ungarnished wood  
Our feelings like water transformed to steam
Our tension breaking through the coffee grinds
Our love story was not an accident

_redo second stanza with more sweetness_

## Lorelai in the Great Flood
Your seduction heist was near mythical
Like a lone sailor, I enchantedly
Bringing with me the entire
Tyrrhenian Sea.

The great flood, we brought to Florence that night.
