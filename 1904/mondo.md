Questions from the wind

The wind ask the fire as it consumes bits of it, offering a new fragrance: Why is your heart blue?
Because my friend the log must die for me to exist

The fire embrace the leave in ember before it devours them, and tenderly whispehrs why do you hind the grandelour of your roots?
Because I am ashamed of kidnapping children of the clouds.

The tree asks the river, why are you in a hurry?
To join the sea for we are late in our dance recital with the wind.

What dance do you perform?
The conga, we swirl and twirl and bring the leaves, the ashes of a flame with us in our wake.
