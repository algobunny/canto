# Nocturna 

In our realm nights prolong  
We await for Apollo's heir  
Enchanced by a corvus' song  

Enticed stumbling into her lair  
She offers the bitter sugar striking instant trust  
Skating darker than black nails through your hair  

Colling into a clandestine trust  
Racing with sands in the hourglass  
before we join them as a pile of dust
