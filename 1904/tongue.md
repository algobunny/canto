# Tongue

In your room or on the subway 
take this gift, from my mind 
delivered to your eyes 
to be enjoyed through your lips 

Tonsils fall into rhythm  
Teeth bite on down a rhyme  
My words, your choice  
Your verse, their voice  
Their song, and I rejoice  
our manifesto!

transforming notions
evoluting inkling seeds
overgrowing in a garden
together transmitting
our revolution
