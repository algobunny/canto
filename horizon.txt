Beyond the Horizon

[6] Each day I take one step
[8] in my academic pursuit
[6] Each disappointment brings
[9] me closer to letting go of you

[6] My muse, my horizon
[8] Remains the same as I close in
[5] What awaits beyond? Why
[8] does the frustrum never change?

[7] Is the world actually flat?
[4] Will I fall off
[7] When I reach this horizon

*
[12] Do you believe, in life beyond the horizon
