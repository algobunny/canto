Daffy & Cissy (sonnet)

"Mirror mirror upon these walls,
show the self that is not I,
the me in another body," Cissy calls.
Appears Daffy with his head high.

Daffy and Cissy transfixed in one another's gaze
Cissy and Daffy never another had they adored
But Daffy wanted more, to hold Cissy forever days
Determined to rescue, he pointed his sword

All of Cissy's mirrors shatters
Shards rain on her, as Daffy falls through a mirror
Dress and flesh sliced to tatters
Blood and spirit escapes Cissy without a shiver

Daffy and Cissy, legendary mirrored lovers
Beyond our reflections, lay what wonders?
