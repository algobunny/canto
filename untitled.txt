I wouldn't have wanted you
Every day, in my skin, in my face
Think my brain will suffocate
Need my space
I would not want to look into your eyes
every night and watch the envy invade

But yet, I can't shake this feeling
And loose sleep every night becausue your happy
I'm not jealous of her, but of you
You found what you were looking for

And it's not fair, because you're never there...
As a friend. Oh you're a terrible friend
As they say, with friends like that
You better wear chainmail, all the time

Does she take you to the river
where we spent our secret Sunday
Think of me when you kiss her
We both know hearts will stray

Do you think we could have had the chance
to laugh for a few more hours
Another kiss, another day to call ours

If you could hold me in your arms
We'll count a few more stars
Share another secret or two,
would it have brought us closer
Bite down deeper, and leave a permnament scar
