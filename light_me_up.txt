Verse 1:
[6] Saw the tricks up your sleeves,
[10] So I tucked my heart under my collar
[6] Yet in just two hours,
[9] I felt I had known you forever
[8] Sold me on all we could have been

Chorus:
[8] You light me up then blow me out
[9] I want to burn with you baby, burn baby
[8] 
[9] 

Verse 2:
[11] Counting down the day until I see you again
[10] Dyed my hair in the shade of red you loved
[10] When that time arrives, you say not today baby
[10] Don't you know colors fade; why not today
[10] Maybe I was sold on the illusion of him

Chorus

Verse 3: 
[10] What is a cold candle but wax and wick?
[10] If I cannot illuminate your world?
[9] What am I, but made to burn for you?
[8] Inch by inch, you can burn me out
[10] Piece by piece you can chip away my heart
