Chorus:
[7] Light me up then blow me out
[9] I want to burn with you baby, burn baby
[10] Let us end, in mutually assured
[8]  combustion; not as dying flame

[11] Counting down the day until I see you again
[10] Dyed my hair in the shade of red you loved
[10] When that time arrives, you say not today baby
[10] Don't you know colors fade; why not today
