This story starts with Salvador Dali's paintings. I had just started my new job at a small startup. Small being the operative word. It was in a 200sq ft room with 5 other developers. Sitting opposite to me was an iOS developer, who had a rotating collection of surrealist paintings for his wallpapers. I had been a long fan of surrealist art, his wallpapers caught my attention. I believe a person's artistic preferences tells depths about them. The music we listen to resonates with the emotions we are feel and are unaware of. Based on his wallpaper collection, I told myself I should get to know this kid better.
</p>

<p>His name was Kevin, from St. Louis, Missouri. Yes St. Louis, that same place Jason moved to. Jason, the ghost in the story. The driving force behind so many missteps and mishaps. He persistently haunts me even now. Jason leaving was the hardest lost I had face in my 25 years. We were just an integral part of each other, we reflect of each other. For a long time when I looked in the mirror there was no one in the reflection. Based on these two coincidences alone, the St. Louis transplant and the Dali fan, I felt inexplicably drawn to him. To cope with the lost of Jason, I was in the market for a binge on self-destruction.</p>

<p>At that time I just started dating Prince. He was one of those nice and okay looking guys, I wasn't attracted to him. But when he asked me out, I saw no reason to not give it a chance. Afterall, it had been a while since I dated. When I moved back to NY, I wasn't looking for a boyfriend. I was actally hoping to date around. I wanted to run wild, in hopes it will help me get over Jason. It was something I should have done right away, but I never got a chance to in Virginia, as there wasn't many people to run wild with down there. Even tough, I said I wasn't ready for a serious relationship, we got really serious really fast. More percisely, my time got consumed by him really fast. He was always there. I didn't know having a BF meant we had to see eachother almost every day. Especially since Guy and I only saw eachohther once or twice a month, true that might have been a little too sporadic. But maybe two or three times a week, was what I thought I had signed up for. He was always there waiting for me to get home from work, and I sometimes caught myself lying about having to "stay late at work" just for a chance to hang out with my co-workers, a chance to get to know Kevin better. </p>

<p>When I first joined the company, I was hoping for a chance to move into doing some Android development. But I never got the chance because, I was a paid employee and they simply didn't have the time for me to do something I was less skilled at over something I was more skilled in.
Even though they got away with low cost development labor by bringing in interns, and that made most of the Android team. I at least had a CS degree. </p>

<p>I was one of the few random hires, everyone else was brought in by someone else. My teammate, Sam brought in Kevin due to family connections. Kevin brought in his best friend Alec, who did customer support. He then later proceeded to bring in a friend from college, Ryan, as a developer intern. </p>

<p>He graduated with a physics degree, who had what little experience most physics majors had with programming. Originally they were thinking about putting him on Android, because he knew Java. That upset me, because if they were going to hire Android developers based on their knowledge of Java alone, then I would be much more qualified. "Alice, green is not a pretty color on you. You are above jealousy, it's unlady like," I told myself. </p>

<p>But Ryan never joined the Android team, because Kevin needed someone to help him fight against Mike. So instead, he trained Ryan to be his protege. He even bought him into the room, shared between the Platform team and SDK. For lunch, Ryan would wash carrots and lettuce and just eat them raw... we asked if he was a rabbit. </p>

<p>The two were really close then. Once Ryan's brother invited Kevin to dinner with him and his girlfriend. I asked Ryan, "Oh is Kevin your date then?", and he supposed so. They were inseparable, when Nick finally decided to move all non API people out of the room, Kevin made a small desk next to his desk to put Ryan back in. </p>

<p>At our office then, we were constantly playing a game of musical chairs. My company didn't have a dedicated HR person, everyone was still trying to figure group dyanmics out. Eventually they decided to mesh all the Java developers together, and placed in our room the Android team. This meant that Kevin had to move out back into the "living room area". I was a little sad to see him go, after all we just started to get to know eachother a little. And he also expressed reluctance to move out of that room we shared. </p>

<p>"The lighting was good there," he said, even though for most of the time we kept our shades down due to the  morning sun that would shine upon our screens. He packed his stuff with such hiss and fit, we all were a little turned over that Friday and joined on his quest of re-organizing the junk our room and the office. I think it was at that evening, that we started the Bytemark library. </p>

<p>Chapter Title: 99 Ballons<br />
When Kevin first graduated college, he spent 3 months with his girlfriend at that time in Germany. He loved order, logic, and structure, and he loved Germany. And he wouldn't stop talking about Germany and his ex, Steffie. Back then, I felt that if we became anything I would always be in her shadow. Like Jason, who will haunt every relationship I find myself in. She will always be the sun, and the memory of her will cast a shadow upon whatever Kevin and I may potentially have.

<p>For some reason, I always got along really well with Physics and (pure) Math majors. Maybe it was in the way we saw life in abstractions, our ability to see patterns every where. Maybe it is because we didn't stop our questioning when given an response, we wanted an explanation of the answer. Let us fall into the hell pit of our reductive reasoning. We wanted truth of truths, and we won't settle for less. Because Ryan was a Physics major, I always thought we would get along. But we never really got to know eachother or talk much. The little I knew of him, I found off putting.</p>

<p>After Kevin, moved out of the room and into the living room with the rest of his team. I would pass by them all the time. There was one time, when I walked through their conversation.</p>

<p>"I'll sleep with her, if she is not a bitch. She can be a bitch, and I'll still sleep with her," said Ryan.</p>

<p>Kevin and I looked at eachother thinking, '<i>Doesn't that boy have any standards?</i>' I then said, "So it doesn't matter if she is a bitch."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Ryan answered. Then I concluded <i>okay, maybe I don't really want to get to know this kid</i>.</p>
