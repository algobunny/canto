[8] Her voice so sweet, Her fingers dance
[8] Upon the keys in gentle grace

[7] Is she everything you dreamed,
[6] All you will ever need

[4] I'll never be
[7] How can I ever compete
[4] With your Clare
[6] If she swims, I will run

 Chorus:
 [4] So done with this
 [4] Don't measure me
 [4] Just treasure me
 [4] I'll never be
 [3] like Cla-re

[8] Watch her dance movements of water
[5] My love is fire

[6] Clare is grounded like roots
[6] I am one with the wind
[6] Every where you'll feel me
[7] Never can you contained me

[9] If you feel my touch come fly with me
[8] You and I belong to the sky

x Chorus

[8] She's a smart girl will get you through
[4] The maze called life

[6] But I'll break through its walls
[6] Show you all the shortcuts

[7] With her you'll have to be strong
[7] I embrace your weakness
[4] Nurse your darkness
[4] Confide in me
[4] All your secrets

Bridge:
[4] You'll never tell
[5] her your fantasies
[5] I'm your fantasy
[2] (Come true)
[5] We are a dirty
[3] Little secret
[2] (keep us)
[7] A secret this time around

x Chorus

[6] Cla-re's eyes, the ocean
[7] Do you see your face, in them?

[8] My gla-res are arrows, they pierce
[8] And leave scars to never fa-de

[4] Look in my eyes
[5] Let me draw you in
[4] In me there is
[4] No gravity

x Chorus

[8] Her ha-ir, regal in the sun
[6] *(chords) I am blood, baby
