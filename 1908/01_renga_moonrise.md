We wake upon moon rise  
and on some days, never at all  
off rhythm to earth's twirling grace  

toast to banish tears of days past  
tears summoned upon a dice roll  

fears sink like tannin in aged red  
words spill unchecked by doubt  
we bleed lyrical, wounds ignored  

until dawn when the gash  
and mishaps of night's past  

these moments are jigsaw pieces  
some pieces your cat ate last night
